Chunk 2:
Can I have more information on your
Waste Electrical and Electronic
Equipment (WEEE) and battery
recycling policy?
Why recycle?
Unwanted electrical equipment & batteries are the UKs fastest growing type of
waste.
For household batteries we have special collection points in all our UK Boots stores
where you can dispose of batteries which will then be recycled.
Many electrical items can be repaired or recycled, saving natural resources and the
environment. If you do not recycle, electrical equipment will end up in landfill where
hazardous substances will leak out and cause soil and water contamination -
harming wildlife and also human health. Please do not throw any electrical
equipment in your household bins.
We are pleased to offer our customers the chance to recycle their old electrical
items.
What Boots do
Boots supports the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Regulations,
which means we provide takeback of electrical equipment in all of our stores â€“ we
takeback small electrical items which we sell such as hairdryers, hair styling
equipment and toothbrushes.
To find out more about where you can recycle electrical waste, simply
visit www.recycle-more.co.uk or contact our free helpline 0800 915 9023.
To remind you that old electrical equipment can be recycled, it is now marked with a
crossed-out wheelie bin symbol. Please do not throw any electrical equipment
(including those marked with the crossed-out wheelie bin symbol) in your bin.
What is WEEE?
The Waste Electrical or Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires countries to
maximise separate collection and environmentally friendly processing of these items.
In the UK, distributors (including retailers) must provide a system which allows all
customers buying new electrical equipment the opportunity to recycle their old items
free of charge. Those establishing their own take-back scheme must as a minimum
offer all customers buying new electrical equipment free take back of their old
electricals on a like-for-like basis.
Find more information on WEEE recycling, and locate your local recycling centre,
at www.recyclenow.com.

Chunk 15:
How do Boots try to detect & prevent
crime?
To protect our customers, our staff and our business, we may use your personal
data to help prevent and detect crime. We use CCTV to record images in our stores,
and when you place an order on our website, we carry out identity verification and
fraud prevention checks, validating the personal information you give against
appropriate third-party databases. This may involve disclosing information to a Credit
Reference Agency, which will keep a record of that information and may pass it to
the police.
If you require access to CCTV footage (for example, if you are the victim of a crime
that takes place on Boots premises), you should write to us at:
Central Customer Care Team
D94
Nottingham
NG90 1BS
UK
We will ask you to provide proof of your identity, the date and approximate time of
the incident you wish to view and as much detail as you can to help us locate the
correct footage, and we may make a small charge. We will do our best to help, but
there are situations in which we may be unable to make CCTV footage available to
you, such as where the incident occurred some time ago or if we believe that
allowing you to view it would breach someone else's privacy.


Chunk 16:
Is the Boots website secure?
All of our pages that deal with your personal or payment information are HTTPS
secured so your data will be safe. Some of our other pages are in the process of
being moved from the HTTP to the HTTPS platform. As a result, you may see parts
of our website flagged as unsecured, these pages donâ€™t handle your personal data
and wonâ€™t compromise your shopping experience.
